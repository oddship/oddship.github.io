# About Oddship

## A place for builders who rebuild themselves

Oddship exists for people who treat identity as practice, not position. Those who change their tools mid-project because the project taught them something new. Who find more truth in transition than in arrival.

We're not a community in the usual sense. No membership, no onboarding, no scale targets. More like a lighthouse: a signal for other ships navigating similar waters.

## What you'll find here

**[The Manifesto](/about/manifesto)** — The philosophy behind oddship. Why we rebuild ourselves at sea. What it means to be a vessel rather than a monument.

**[Chronicles](/chronicles)** — A builder's log. The daily record of making things: what broke, what worked, what changed. Ship's log, not blog post.

## The name

The Ship of Theseus asks: if you replace every plank, is it still the same ship?

We think that's the wrong question. The interesting part isn't the paradox—it's the practice. Every plank replaced, every sail patched, every course corrected: this is the work.

The *odd* ship is the one that keeps rebuilding while moving. Most become monuments to their past selves. We choose to remain vessels.

## For whom

For builders who need to see other builders actually building.

For those tired of pretending every step was intentional.

For anyone who knows that making things means changing your mind.

If you rebuild yourself while moving forward, you're already sailing these waters.
